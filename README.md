## About Me

Hi, I'm Lucas. To me, good data always tells a story, but finding quality data and uncovering the correct story is the real science. 

As a data scientist, I focus on ensuring data is functional for the project goals and finding the most effective machine learning solutions. I specialize in:
- Data cleaning, model selection, and effective communication
- Modeling using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and PyTorch for NLP, GLM, and image recognition
- Querying data with SQL
- Building dashboards with Tableau
- Creating and maintaining APIs using Flask and Postman

I have a passion for applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems. Check out my projects below!


## Work Experience

**Data Scientist Intern – Kaiser Permanente (Jul 2022 – Dec 2022)**
- Developed an NLP model using MedSpaCy for automating clinical note scoring, reducing doctor workload by 800 hours.
- Automated weekly ETL processes with Bash scripts, reducing manual work by 10 hours per week.
- Built RESTful APIs for NVIDIA Clara scripts using Flask and SQLAlchemy, streamlining data workflows.

**Research Intern – Children's Hospital of Orange County (Sep 2022 – Dec 2022)**
- Predicted NICU patient readmissions using ClinicalBERT and BioBERT models, achieving a 0.7 F1-score.
- Enhanced model accuracy by 5% by optimizing spaCy-based tokenization and entity recognition.


## Projects

### [Bird Call Classification - Sound Event Detection](https://github.com/lmorgan168/Bird-Call-Detection-BirdClef)
The purpose of this project is to address the challenge of limited data and manual annotation in bioacoustics. We implemented:
- **ResNet38 Model**: Pretrained audio neural network for bird call detection.
- **Mel-Spectrograms**: Converted audio data into spectrograms for CNN input.
- **Focal Loss**: Enhanced the Cross-Entropy Loss function to prioritize misclassified examples.
- **Results**: Achieved an F1-score of 0.684, ranking in the top 15% on Kaggle.
