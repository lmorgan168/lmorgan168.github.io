## About Me

Hi, I'm Lucas. To me, good data always tells a story, but finding quality data and uncovering the correct story is the real science. 

As a data scientist, I focus on ensuring data is functional for the project goals and finding the most effective machine learning solutions. I specialize in:
- Data cleaning, model selection, and effective communication
- Modeling using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and PyTorch for NLP, GLM, and image recognition
- Querying data with SQL
- Building dashboards with Tableau
- Creating and maintaining APIs using Flask and SQLAlchemy

I have a passion for applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems. Check out my projects below!


## Work Experience

**Data Scientist Intern – Kaiser Permanente (Jul 2022 – Dec 2022)**
- Developed an NLP API endpoint using MedSpaCy to score 10,000 clinical Parkinson's patient notes to enhance clinical analysis accuracy.
- Automated weekly ETL processes from Clarity, the central data warehouse, using Python and Bash to simplify database updates and to enable faster demo preparation.
- Deployed and maintained a RESTful API endpoint for NVIDIA Clara brain tumor segmentation models with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Docker, integrating assisted medical imaging capabilities into clinical workflows

**Research Intern – Children's Hospital of Orange County (Sep 2022 – Dec 2022)**
- Predicted hospital readmissions for 4,192 NICU patient notes with a 0.7 F1 score using rule-based NLP and adapted BERT models, including ClinicalBERT and BioBERT.
- Employed spaCy for clinical note preprocessing, executing tokenization, stop word elimination, and entity recognition, increasing prediction accuracy by 5%.


## Projects

### [Bird Call Classification - Sound Event Detection](https://github.com/lmorgan168/Bird-Call-Detection-BirdClef)
<img src="assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-02-08%20at%202.04.09%20PM.png" alt="" width="500">
The purpose of this project is to address the challenge of limited data and manual annotation in bioacoustics. We implemented:
- **ResNet38 Model**: Pretrained audio neural network for bird call detection.
- **Mel-Spectrograms**: Converted audio data into spectrograms for CNN input.
- **Focal Loss**: Enhanced the Cross-Entropy Loss function to prioritize misclassified examples.
- **Results**: Achieved an F1-score of 0.684, ranking in the top 15% on Kaggle.

### [Grocery Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/lmorgan168/Grocery-Store-Sales-Time-Series)
This project aimed to predict grocery store sales using historical data:
- **5-Layer LSTM Network**: Built using Keras for long-term time series forecasting.
- **Supervised Learning Transformation**: Transformed time-series data into supervised learning inputs by incorporating time steps as features.
- **Results**: Achieved a top 20% ranking on Kaggle, demonstrating high prediction accuracy for sales trends.

### [Data Structure Efficiency and Word Frequency Analysis](https://github.com/lmorgan168/Data-Structures-Asmyptotic-Efficiency)
This project explores how data structure choice impacts computational performance by implementing a word frequency analysis algorithm. Key highlights include:

- **Problem**: Analyze word frequencies in a document, excluding common stopwords.
- **Algorithm**: Iteratively count word occurrences using different data structures.
- **Data Structures Compared**: 
  - Unsorted Vector, Unsorted Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Search Tree.
- **Results**: 
  - Hash table was **374x faster** than a linked list, showcasing the importance of O(1) amortized efficiency.
  - Observed times aligned well with theoretical expectations.

### [Hash Table Implementations - Performance Comparison](https://github.com/lmorgan168/Hash-Benchmark-Comparison)
This project benchmarks four dictionary data structures to analyze performance:

- **Structures**: Naive, Chaining, Linear Probing, Cuckoo.
- **Features**: Benchmarked `set` and `search` operations with performance visualized in scatter plots.
- **Results**:
  - **Fastest**: Cuckoo and Chaining.
  - **Slowest**: Naive (O(n) complexity).
  - **Trade-Offs**: Chaining balances simplicity and speed; Cuckoo excels in performance but is complex to implement.
