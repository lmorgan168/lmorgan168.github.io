### About me

Hey, I'm Lucas.  To me, good data always tells a story, but how to get quality data and deciphering the correct story is the real science. As a data scientist, I strive to always ensure that the data is functional for the project goal at hand and to always find the most suitable machine learning solution to complete the objective. I specialize in data cleaning, model selection, and effective communication. 
* Modeling using Python libraries Scikit-Learn (regression/boosting/etc.) and PyTorch (NLP/GLM/image recognition) 
* Querying Data using SQL
* Developing dashboards using Tableau
* Creating and maintaining API's using Flask and Postman

### Work Experience

**Data Scienctist Intern @ Kaiser Permanente Care Delivery and Analytics (Jul 2022 - January 2023)**
* Developed an NLP API endpoint to automatically score 10,000 hand-written clinical parkinson notes, reducing doctor workload by 800 hours
* Developed Bash scripts to automate weekly ETL processes from central data warehouse Clarity, reducing 10 hours for weekly load times
* Transformed 15 NVIDIA Clara scripts into RESTful API's using Flask and SQLite

**Research Intern @ Children's Hospital of Orange County (Sep 2022 - Dec 2022)**
* Developed an improved predictive model on 4192 NICU patient readmissions using rule-based NLP and adapted BERT models, resulting in an increase of 15% on prediction accuracy
* Optimized model performance using spaCy to preprocess and tokenize clinical notes 

### Projects

**Bird Call Classification - Sound Event Detection**

The purpose of the BirdClef Kaggle competition is that current methods for preprocessing large bioaccoustic datasets involve manual annotation of each recording, which requires specialized training and large amounts of time. Additionally, there are even less recordings of rare and endangered species. Thus, the goal is to train reliable classifiers with limited training data. In our submission, we implement a pre-trained audio Neural Network with a ResNet38 backbone. We achieved a notable F1-Score of 0.684 in the top 15%. The implementation process included preprocessing and converting the audio recorsings into Mel-Spectrograms allowing for use of CNN's. We also implemented a modified Cross Entropy Loss Function with Focal Loss to allow for more emphasis on misclassified examples due to the limited training dataset.
